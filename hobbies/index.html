        <h2>What are my hobbies?</h2>
        <p>
          As one might assume, as an ITM major at a tech university, I am a huge nerd.
          I collect Pokémon cards and Funko Pops with my girlfriend, Abigale.
          I also play my fair share of video games, athough I have not had as much freetime since this semester started.
          When I DO have enough free time, I like to play Old School RuneScape and Destiny 2.
          Once this pandemic is over, I would like to start playing Super Smash Bros. again with some friends.
          I work at Best Buy while also attending school full time, so I do not have as much freetime as I would like.

        <h2>Collectibles</h2>
        <h3>Pokémon Cards</h3>
        <p>
          Like many Americans, I found myself with a lot of spare time at the beginning of the Coronavirus pandemic.
          So, I started collecting Pokémon cards. While my collection is nothing special, it still is a lot of fun to rip open
          a pack or two after a long week. Since my girlfriend also likes to collect, it is really nice to find another thing for us to bond over.
          Our favorite sets to collect are: Vivid Voltage, Shining Fates, and the new Evolving Skies set that recently released this August.
        </p>
        <h3>Funko Pops</h3>
        <p>
          While Pokémon cards are a more recent collection, I have been collecting Funko Pops since 2016.
          I mainly collect the Dragon Ball line of figures, but I have branched out to other series like Full Metal Alchemist and Destiny.
          My girlfriend recently started collecting Hamilton Funko Pops as that is her favorite musical.

        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <h3>Old School RuneScape</h3>
        <p>
          RuneScape is a game that almost feels like home to me.
          I have fond memories of playing it back when I was a child in grade school.
          Old School, with its 2007-esque aesthetic is very nostalgic to me.
          I enjoy playing "iron man mode" which turns the MMO into a single-player game, greatly increasing the difficulty.
        </p>
        <h3>Destiny 2</h3>
        <p>
          Destiny is... a very special game to me. Sure I've played video games for hours on end, staying up way too late,
          but never have I been so enthralled by a video game franchise. It is my favorite game.
          I have met so many friends on that game and even run a clan with two other close friends I made playing Destiny.
          I have four exclusive jackets for completing a new raid im the first week of release. I am very passionate about the game.
